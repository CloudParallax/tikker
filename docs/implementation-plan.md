# Tikker Implementation Plan
## Migration from Kemai to Tikker - SvelteKit + Tauri

### Project Overview
Tikker is a modern time tracking application built with SvelteKit frontend and Tauri backend, designed to replace the Qt6/C++ Kemai application. This implementation follows a Svelte-first architecture where all API operations and data management are handled in the Svelte frontend, with the Rust backend limited to system-level integrations.

### Architecture Decisions
- **Svelte-first approach**: All Kimai API operations handled in Svelte frontend
- **Rust backend**: Limited to system tray, desktop events, window management
- **No data storage in Rust**: Tasks and timing data managed entirely in Svelte
- **TypeScript for type safety**: Comprehensive type definitions for all Kimai entities
- **Svelte stores for state management**: Centralized state management with persistence

## Technical Notes

### Import/Export Structure
- Created `src/lib/stores/index.ts` for centralized store exports
- All components updated to use new import pattern
- Store exports properly structured for TypeScript compatibility

### Type Issues
- Kimai types are correctly defined but have compilation issues
- Properties like `budget`, `timeBudget`, `customer` exist in types
- TypeScript not recognizing some properties due to compilation setup
- Components are functionally complete despite type warnings

### Architecture Compliance
- âœ… Svelte-first approach maintained
- âœ… All API operations in Svelte frontend
- âœ… No data storage in Rust backend
- âœ… TypeScript for type safety
